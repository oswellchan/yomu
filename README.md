* Ensure `ios/Flutter/App.framework` directory is empty when changing build target (e.g. between Simulator and actual device). See [this](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/50568#issuecomment-609465675)
* While building, sometimes you might get
    ```
    Xcode's output:
    â†³
        note: Using new build system
        note: Building targets in parallel
        note: Planning build
        note: Constructing build description
        error: No profiles for '<profile>' were found: Xcode couldn't find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching '<profile>'. Automatic signing is disabled and unable to generate a profile. To enable automatic signing, pass
